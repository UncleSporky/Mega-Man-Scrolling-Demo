These bitmaps are actually inverted from what they need to be in Arduboy code.

The program I use to convert them is called LCD Assistant:

It outputs black as a 1 and white as 0, but on the Arduboy, by default white is
a solid pixel and is thus 1, and black is 0.

Converting bitmaps before including them in your program is important.  The
Arduboy's screen receives bytes in an unconventional way, oriented vertically
instead of horizontally.  There is no easy way to convert a normal left-to-right,
top-to-bottom bitmap outside of a complex conversion done on the fly in code,
which is very time consuming, or via a conversion program like the one above.
